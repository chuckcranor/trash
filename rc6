rc6 is ready!

The package is here:
https://github.com/zhengqmark/deltafs-umbrella/releases/download/1.0-rc6-sp2dx/deltafs-umbrella-1.0rc6-sp2dx-TTs.tar.gz

The tar name is deltafs-umbrella-1.0rc6-sp2dx-TTs.tar.gz

There is an "s" after "TT", which indicates this package is desired for 
core specialization (ppn is set to 31).

So we first wget and build it on TT.

I think maybe you can put it under /users/ccranor/aug17/r6s ^_^

This time, nexus will also participate in the build.

I tried it on Travis and it worked, though nexus tests wouldn't work so 
I disabled it.

After that, we will do

#!/bin/sh

std="--constraints haswell --experiment sc17b --iterations 1 \
--overcommit enable --tag rc6s-try1 --tests baseline,deltafs \
